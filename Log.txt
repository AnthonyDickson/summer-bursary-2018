Wikipedia page on Waveguides
Summary
From wikipedia:
“A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound, with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two.”
How a waveguide works can be contrasted with broadcasting, broadcasting sends a signal in all direction, whereas a waveguide sends, or rather directs, a signal in a particular direction.


Waveguides are limited by what wavelengths can be transmitted through them. Large wavelengths make constructing a suitable waveguide structure infeasible. For example. a radio wave with a frequency of 3 MHz has a wavelength of about 100m, making hollow metal waveguides impractical due to the large diameter tubing required. There is also a phenomenon called ‘waveguide cutoff frequency’, which is essentially the lowest frequency mode that can be propagated through a system, any modes with a lower frequency suffer from a loss of energy (referred to as attenuation).
Waveguides a particularly useful for microwave and optical frequency ranges.
Parts I did not Really Understand
The ‘propagation modes and cutoff frequencies’ and ‘impedance’ matching sections.


Looked at wikipedia page on waveguide cutoff frequency.


List of related equations.


Wikipedia Page on Waveguide Filters
“Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the passband), while others are rejected (the stopband).”

Research Paper - Deep Learning with Coherent Nanophotonic Circuits
Annotated Version
Deep learning (specifically matrix multiplication and non-linearities) is optically realisable. The main components of the system presented in the paper are waveguides, phase shifters, and components that leverage saturable absorption and bistability. 


There is a potential 2x speedup in computation speed and 3x reduction in power consumption. Additionally, forward passes on CNNs and RNNs supposedly run in constant time and it may be possible to train these networks with forward propagation (i.e. without backpropagation).


As far as I can tell there are not any particular restrictions to the matrix calculations it can do. They are using SVD (singular value decomposition) so that may impose some restrictions. 
Not quite sure what the limitations on the non linearities are.
It should be noted that in their experiments the ONN (optical neural network) achieved 76.7% accuracy compared to 91.7% of the NN trained purely on a conventional computer.


I think that this paper, and its related research, will serve as a good basis for simulating NNs optically. A good next step may be to look at SVD and investigate if there are any limitations, or to look into how the non-linearities are computed and any limitations.


Seems like any real-valued matrix is okay. This is implied in the last paragraph in the left column on page two.


Things I do not understand:
* What SVD is and how it works
* What the non-linearities produced by saturable absorption look like.
   * I was told that saturable absorption produces a plot that looks like the softplus function - I think this is from the relation between the formula for the absorption rate and the Wright Omega function.

Section 2.3.4 of the supplementary demonstrates the softplus-like function.
   * In this paper, plotting peak incident intensity against peak transmission produces a plot that looks similar to the sigmoid function.
   * However in this paper, plotting peak intensity (not sure if this is the same as peak incident intensity in the previous paper or not) against percent transmission produces a plot that looks similar to log growth.

Article on Singular Value Decomposition for Machine Learning and Wikipedia Page on Singular Value Decomposition
“The Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD for short, is a matrix decomposition method for reducing a matrix to its constituent parts in order to make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler.”

Where A is the original matrix, U is a m✕m unitary matrix, Σ is a m✕n diagonal matrix, and is a n✕n unitary matrix.

Research Paper - Monolayer Graphene as a Saturable Absorber in a Mode-Locked Laser
Details the parameters and setup of their saturable absorber. They seemed to be using a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser system. With this laser system and a input power in the range [-30 dBm, -2.5 dBm] (or [1 µW, ~1778 µW]), the transmission loss dropped from 5.1 dB to 0.14 dB. From this perhaps we can infer that the initial transmittance, , is -35.1 dBm (309 nW) and the maximum transmittance, , is -2.64 dBm (~0.55 mW).

Week 2 - Wednesday, November 21
Worked on trying to get a rough simulation of saturable absorption running in python - check the GitHub page to see what was worked on today. A quick summary would be that I haven’t been able to reproduce the plot from the supplementary of ‘Deep learning with coherent nanophotonic circuits’. It might also be worth noting that the plot looks like the one in the paper ‘Monolayer Graphene as a Saturable Absorber in a Mode-Locked Laser’ (look at figure 2c).


Research Paper - Experimental Realization of Any Discrete Unitary Operator
Details recursive algorithm that factorises any  unitary matrix into a sequence of two-dimensional beam splitter transformations. 


Mentions Hilbert space, and says that:
“one can set up an experiment equivalent to any U(N) matrix by using these beam splitter devices such that successive U(2) transformations are performed on two-dimensional subspaces of the full N-dimensional Hilbert space”
where the beam splitter devices referred to are Mach-Zehnder interferometers.


Figure 3 shows how these beam splitter devices could be arranged any  unitary matrix.
Supplementary Information for Deep Learning with Coherent Nanophotonic Circuits
There were testing with 5, 13, 16, and 24 bits of precision - this seemed to be a limitation of the voltage supply they had. Maybe this means that floats would have to be converted to half precision or 24-bit minifloats (Nvidia seemed to have used a 24-bit minifloat with 7 bits for the exponent and 16 bits for the mantissa).


When they refer to ‘Reck encoding’ and ‘Reck circuits’, I think ‘Reck’ is referring to Michael Reck who was one of the authors of the above paper, Experimental Realization of Any Discrete Unitary Operator and the ‘encoding’ and ‘circuits’ are referring to the corresponding concepts discussed in the same paper.


What is the SU(2) Lie group?


Covers the programming of the nanophotonic circuit and how Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) are used. It also touches on how MZIs can be used to decompose an arbitrary unitary matrix via two different methods: (a) the method described by Reck et al., and another method (b) described by Clements et al. in the paper An Optimal Design for Universal Multiport Interferometers.


Their photodiode arrays have a dynamic range of 35 dB - but they say it would be manageable to achieve a higher dynamic range. This range would limit the range of values that could be represented within the system.


Summary of Readings To Date
Matrix multiplication is certainly possible via optical methods. The main method that I explored was detailed in Deep Learning with Coherent Nanophotonic Circuits. This circuit used in this paper seems to use a combination of Mach-Zehnder interferometers and phase shifters to perform matrix multiplication. It seems that the way to make this possible is to use singular value decomposition (SVD) to represent matrices, I would presume that this imposes the limitation that matrices would need to be able to be decomposed with SVD. 


Saturable absorbers are used for creating nonlinearities, and the nonlinearity that is produced has a similar shape to that of softplus in the domain of positive real numbers. The authors mention that the function that gives this nonlinearity is an odd function, so the shape may affect training?
  

The architecture explored in the paper mentioned above seems to be limited to 24-bit precision.

Summary of Readings To Date For Real This Time
   * Matrix multiplication possible optically, seemingly with any arbitrary  real-valued matrix
   * Matrices need to be reduced with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
   * SVD decomposes a matrix into three parts, one of which is a diagonal matrix and the other two are unitary matrices.
   * This is important because there is a method to factorise any arbitrary  unitary matrix into a sequence of two-dimensional beam splitters.
   * The system in the paper ‘Deep Learning with Coherent Nanophotonic Circuits’ implies a limit on precision depending on the system. Their system seems to be limited to 24-bits, which would equate to a 24-bit minifloat.
   * Their system is also limited to 1000 neurons.
   * In regards to nonlinearities, the curve produced by saturable absorption in the same paper as above is indeed similar to softplus.
   * Probably not relevant to the hardware side of things, but the function that describes the maximum transmitted intensity w.r.t incident intensity is an odd function. So if you go far enough from the origin, the function is linear in both the positive and negative domains, unlike relu. This might affect training since the gradient would be constant in those areas.
