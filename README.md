# Summer Project
This project looks into the viability of a device for machine learning that uses light for computation.

## Getting Started
If you are using conda you can create the conda environment used for the project with command:
```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create an environment called `summer-project`.
Otherwise, make sure your python environment is set up with packages listed in the file `environment.yml`

If the operating system that you are using is Windows, then you will need to install the PyTorch packages using the 
instructions found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
