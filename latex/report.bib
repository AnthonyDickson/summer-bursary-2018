abstract = "We experimentally demonstrated an optoelectronic artificial neuron model, which can perform sigmoid transfer function. The proposed optoelectronic circuit can mimic the behavior of continuous sigmoidal neuron based on the nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) in a single semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). Because the current-induced NPR is anti-parallel to the optical power-induced NPR, excitatory and inhibitory stimuli to the proposed artificial neuron can be implemented by optical injection and electrical modulation, respectively. The response of the proposed neuron to excitatory inputs and inhibitory inputs are related to the initial state of polarization (SOP), bias current and power of probe beam. By adjusting the initial SOP, the neuron can be more likely to be excited or inhibited."
